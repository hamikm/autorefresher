# autorefresher
Periodically checks a webpage for updates and emails them, if any, to you. Replace the `TODO`s in the script with your info, enable "insecure apps" in Gmail (ideally not on your real account), and run the script in the background.

See the `example_adaptations` directory for examples. I've included one that periodically checks the Hanford, CA weather discussion page and emails the discussion if its timestamp is more recent than the last one's. I found it useful for automating obsessive refreshing ahead of a [six-day ski tour](http://www.supertopo.com/tr/Skiing-Across-the-Range-of-Light/t11476n.html).
